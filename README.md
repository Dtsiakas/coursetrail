# EduSeeker

**Bachelor Thesis Project - University of Piraeus, Department of Informatics**

Interactive web application for discovering and recommending the most suitable online courses with a focus on user preferences.

## Overview

EduSeeker aggregates online courses from multiple platforms (Udemy, Coursera, edX, Pluralsight, YouTube) and provides personalized, explainable recommendations based on user preferences and interactions. The recommendation system is deterministic and transparent, explaining the reasoning behind each suggestion.

## Features

- **Course Discovery** - Browse 200 courses from 5 platforms covering 121 technologies
- **Search & Filtering** - Search by keyword, filter by platform, difficulty, duration, and technology
- **Personalized Recommendations** - Explainable recommendations based on preferences and behavior
- **Multi-Criteria Ratings** - Rate courses on quality, clarity, depth, difficulty, and overall impression
- **Favorites Management** - Save courses with real-time badge updates
- **User Profiles** - Set preferences for technologies, difficulty, depth, and duration
- **Responsive Design** - Full mobile support with hamburger navigation
- **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes

## Technology Stack

cd course-recommendation-app

npm install

npm run dev
```

### Firebase Configuration

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)

└── styles/         # Global CSS variables and styles
```

## Recommendation Engine

The recommendation system uses a deterministic scoring algorithm:

```
Total Score = (Preference Score x 0.6) + (Interaction Score x 0.4)
```

- **Preference Score** (max 100): Technology match, difficulty match, depth match, duration match
- **Interaction Score** (max 100): Similarity to favorited and positively rated courses

Each recommendation includes a human-readable explanation of why it was suggested.
